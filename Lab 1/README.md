# Staging Interaction

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)


## Part A. Plan 

To stage the interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

\*\***<br>
The Setting is home, in the closet and the entry door. It happens when you are picking cloths to wear, or forget bring unberalla when its raining.<br><br>
The players are everyone in the home is involved in the interction. Everyone could benefit from this device.<br><br>
The activity is when the players are picking cloths to wear, the light in the closet will flash different colors of lights to show today's weather. For example, warm yellow for sunny day, blue for rainy day, red for severe weather. And when its rainy outside, and you forget to bring unberalla when leaving, the light in the front door will falsh red light to show you forget the unberalla.<br><br>
The goal for each player is to dress properly according to the werather everyday.<br>**\*\*

Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

\*\***![Story Board](https://github.com/SeanJPeng/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%201/sotryBoard.jpg)**\*\*

Present your idea to the other people in your breakout room. You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

\*\***I got the feedback mentioned that this "weather report" don't have to be just light, there could be correspoding sounds or vocie that help the person know the weather better.**\*\*


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***The falshing light may sometimes feels annoying. Everyting else seems pretty good.**\*\*

\*\***The light with different color will appear for couple seconds, and the lights will go back to its originally color (white). So the person can see what the original color of the cloths are.**\*\*


## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Tinkerbelle is really easy to set up and really easy to use. I am using a windows machine, everything just went smoothly with me. The only thing is taht I reliazed that the screen of my iPhone is not bright enough. So I used my iPad instead.**\*\*


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record.

**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***The setting is basically in the closet. The screen light of my phone is not bright enough. So I changed the device from phone to my iPad. And when I am filming, I closed the closet door as much as I can. So that the different color would show clearly.**\*\*


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***![Device Sketch](https://github.com/SeanJPeng/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%201/deviceSketch.jpg)**\*\*

\*\***The device should be as neglectable as possbile. It should be small and only show the light the light during the necessary time.**\*\*

Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Sometimes it is hard to see in the closet, and colored lights make make it worse. Having regular light until the weather light was asked for would be great.<br>
Users would confuse the red light that represents severe weather with the flashing light that notifying them about the umbrella.<br>
If it is too bright in the room, it is somewhat difficult to see the light. Could add an audio feature along with the light that tells what the weather is for the day.<br>
Blue color may cause confusion about whether its rainy or blue sky.
Add more text in the story board may be better.
Generally people like the unberalla reminding feature.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
